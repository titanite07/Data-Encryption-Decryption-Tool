# Data-Encryption-Decryption-Tool
The "Data Encryption & Decryption Tool" is a Java-based desktop application that provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text data using a simple substitution cipher. It includes two main functionalities: encryption and decryption. The tool allows users to input text data and a secret code, and it performs encryption or decryption based on the selected operation.

Features
Main Menu: The application starts with a main menu that presents three options: Encryption, Decryption, and Exit.

Encryption: Users can choose the "Encryption" option to open a new window for encrypting their text data. The encryption process involves substituting each character in the input text with a modified character based on a numeric code provided by the user. The encrypted result is displayed in a text area, and users can copy the encrypted text for further use.

Decryption: The "Decryption" option opens a window for decrypting encrypted text. Users enter the encrypted text and the original numeric code to reveal the decrypted result. The decrypted output is displayed in a text area, allowing users to view the original text.

Database Integration: The application integrates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve numeric codes associated with code names. A separate window for decryption includes a database query to find the numeric code based on the provided code name.

User-Friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed with Swing components, providing an intuitive and easy-to-use experience. Proper input validation is implemented to handle errors, ensuring the user provides valid data.

How to Use:
Launch Application: Run the application to open the main menu. Select either "Encryption" or "Decryption" based on the desired operation.

Encryption: Enter the text to be encrypted. Input a numeric code for encryption. Click the "Encrypt" button to view the encrypted result. Optionally, copy the encrypted text for use.

Decryption: Enter the encrypted text. Input the original numeric code used for encryption. Click the "Decrypt" button to view the decrypted result.

Exit: Choose the "Exit" option to close the application.

Dependencies:
The application relies on the Java Swing library for the graphical user interface.
It requires a MySQL database for storing and retrieving numeric codes.
Note:
Before using the "Decryption" feature, ensure that the associated MySQL database is properly configured with the required tables.

Future Enhancements:
Implementation of more advanced encryption algorithms for enhanced security.
User authentication and authorization features.
Improved error handling and user feedback.
Conclusion:
The "Data Encryption & Decryption Tool" provides a convenient solution for users who need a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt their text data. With a user-friendly interface and integration with a database, it offers a practical and efficient tool for protecting sensitive information.
